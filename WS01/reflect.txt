1. I don't have any experience with programming besides the few days I practised on. My initial day in the course I feel like this course will be challening and I hope I can manage. 
2. I am not too sure on how to compile a C text file into a executable program but I hope I can get the hang of it soon enough 
3. I hope to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals and I hopefully utilize these skills later on in other courses.
